# Traffic-Signs-Recognition

In this Python project example, we will build a deep neural network model (using CNN & Keras) that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories. With this model, we are able to read and understand traffic signs which are a very important task for all autonomous vehicles.
This project contains 2 parts :

1- the first one is about building the model which has a great acccuracy

2- the second one is about building a graphical user interface for our traffic signs classifier with Tkinter
